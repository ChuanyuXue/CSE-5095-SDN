### 2.1 Aquila: A Practically Usable Verification System for Production-Scale Programmable Data Planes

**Problem:** P4 gives functionality efficiency and flexibility in industry, however it is challengingto prove the correctness of data plane programs, because of multiple pipelines, many functions, various packet paths, and complex function chains.

1. Intent complexity: Hard to formalize the special context like service-specific properties and multi-pipleline control with traditional verification language.
2. Scalability: Too many network functions and dependencies lead to the exponential growth of states and program branches.
3. Buy localization:
4. Reliability of verifier:

**Key insight & novelty:**

1. Intent language LPI is proposed.
2. 

**Limitations:**

**Improvements:**
